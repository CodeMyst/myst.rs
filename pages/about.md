Hello, I am CodeMyst. A programmer who plays around with everything, mainly focusing on web and games. Most of the things I do are open source.

Recently I have mostly worked with less known technologies, trying out a lot of new things because they often do things very different from the "standard", and are more fun to work with. Some of the things I have worked with a lot recently are languages [D](https://dlang.org/) and [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), both are systems level programming languages, trying to be a "replacement" for C and C++ in their own unique ways.

I have of course also worked with more mainstream languages like C# and Java.

Languages: C#, Java, D, Zig, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Rust.

Backends: vibe.d, ASP.Net Core

Engines: Unity, MonoGame
