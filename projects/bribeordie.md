In Bribe or Die you’re a corrupted leader who is slowly losing power over time.

To regain your power you need to make yourself great again. To do that you need to bribe creatures. But be aware. Some creatures only want your money and won’t bring you any power and will even drain it more. So be careful and bribe the right guys! Generally look for more “evil” looking ones, they’re trouble.
