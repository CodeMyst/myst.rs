Submitted for the first Brackeys Game Jam.

*This game didn't get rated because some of the organizers (including me) have worked on this game, meaning we knew the theme in advance and it would be unfair for others.*

Spark of Life is a 3D Puzzle game made in a week for the Brackeys Game Jam. You solve levels by shooting your light gun (not a flashlight!) at light orbs.
